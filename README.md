# 🚀 NVIDIA Force Composition Pipeline Script 🖥️✨

## 📌 What is the NVIDIA Force Composition Pipeline?
The NVIDIA Force Composition Pipeline is a powerful tool that helps to eliminate screen tearing by enforcing a composition pipeline in the NVIDIA settings. This is particularly useful for systems using NVIDIA GPUs where screen tearing can be an issue during video playback, gaming, or general desktop use.
